        <p> Our first project where we shared about ourselves and learned how to use the app Visual Studio Code and developed the basic skills we need for this class.</p>

        <p>Based on Derrida's "Structure Design and Play" we made single page websites about whatever we wanted because the main point of the text was to "play." </p>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left"> Unlike most of my classes, the projects in phase one have allowed me to flex my creative muscle and think outside of the box. The projects have the perfect balance of structure and freedom, allowing me to have a goal and know where my project is headed. Though with this structure, I can choose whatever words, images, designs, or themes I want. This freedom allows me to create projects that I am actually interested in, making me more engaged with the material and more interested in the skills that I’m learning.
</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Engaging with others in a workshop environment has been a crucial part of this class. The requirement of working with others is an important step in the creative process because it allows us to troubleshoot problems that we may have encountered, and then collaborate with our different skill sets to try and fix the issue and improve upon the mistake. Additionally, working with others is an essential skill, no matter what field you go into, so this opportunity to engage with my classmates has been very helpful to me, someone who doesn’t necessarily want to go into a technological field. 
</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Through the projects in phase one, I have been able to think deeply about my craft and truly learn some of the code behind a website and how to hack into it to make it my own. I want to make my project the best it can be, so I have been thinking deeply about the work I put into it, such as selecting the right images or finding other relevant codes to embed into my code. The other components of the class, specifically the workshops, have motivated me to really think about what I am making, how I am making it, and how to improve my work in the future.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

   <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2">
       </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Prior to this class, I knew nothing about coding, websites, or advanced technology, but I have already learned a lot of new information throughout these first three projects. I have been able to gain basic knowledge in digital projects and develop those skills as I learn and create more. The main skill that I have developed has been vibe coding because not only do I utilize AI as a tool to improve my skills, but I then use that code and hack into it myself, so I know how to use that information and code in different areas of my website, or in future projects.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Presenting my work has been a productive and important aspect of this class. I have been able to practice presenting my projects to both a small group and the whole class. I am not only developing my skills in public speaking, but also how to effectively present my projects in an engaging and understandable manner. It is one thing to talk about your creation, but it is much more important to be able to explain it to people and answer questions that they might have. This skill not only improves public speaking, but also your own understanding of your work.

        <p> We created an image essay using the software Adobe Premiere Pro. I based my image essay on my family trip to Denver to watch the musician Gregory Alan Isakov at Red Rocks.</p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left"> This phase of the course really allowed me to be creative and explore different fields and topics that I am interested in. I was able to experiment with the different types of tools and softwares such as Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Character Creator. Through these programs, I got to try out different designs and styles that I liked which allowed me to build up my creative abilities through the content I was working with as well as the layout. I really have learned a lot about the balance between creativity and following directions in order to complete an assignment, adhere to all the guidelines, while also making the project personal, engaging and thoughtful.
</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left"> These past projects have allowed me to engage with others in a workshop environment and develop my collaboration skills. This step in the creative process has really allowed me to deepen my understanding of what we are creating and further enhance my projects by asking others for their feedback and advice. While it is sometimes hard to ask for help, this piece of the class has really allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and become more comfortable in reaching out to others for help. Sharing my projects in the workshop environment has taught me that there is always room for improvement, and that engaging with others is a crucial part of a project since it allows different perspectives, opinions, and thoughts.
</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left"> Since the software we worked with was brand new to me, I was able to think deeply about my craft through this phase because I had to focus and truly understand what I was creating. With each project, I was able to improve my editing and technological skills, which is something I am proud of because when I first started, I had no idea what I was doing. The ability to choose the topic we were researching and creating projects about made me interested and engaged in creating a high quality piece of work. Since I enjoyed what I was creating, it made me care about what the final product looked like, making me think deeply about the work so that I was happy with the end result.
</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left"> This phase was very research heavy which in turn, led me to engage in sustained research and skills development. The first week of research was a little difficult for me because it was challenging to find information on my topic, and once I did find that information, it was difficult to analyze and synthesize into my project. However, once I switched my topic and as I became more comfortable with the research process, I began to like researching and understood how to thouroghly analyze and apply the information I read into my project. Deciding to switch my topic was difficult, especially because that meant I had to start over with the research, but I am very happy with my choice because I am now researching meaningful information that will translate well into my final project.
5. learn to present your work
</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">  The end of this phase has really taught me how to present my work and improve my public speaking skills. We started off small, presenting our projects to others in a workshop environment, and then moved on to presenting in front of the whole class. Public speaking is not my favorite thing to do, but I am happy to have the opportunity to practice my presentation abilities in a small class that are all experiencing the same pressure. Learning how to present my work not only improves my public speaking, but it also ensures that I know what my project is about. Being able to explain to an audience what your work is about is a crucial skill and proves that you really know what you are talking about, so I am grateful that I have the opportunity to work on all of these aspects.
